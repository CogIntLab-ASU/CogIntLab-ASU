          <h2 align="center">Research Narrative</h2><br>
        </header>
		     
Research in our lab and by our lead and his students has evolved over the years.
                 In the early years, the focus was on two foundational areas of AI: 
                 (a) Knowledge Representation and Reasoning 
		     (KR & R) and 
                 (b) Actions, Agents and Planning (AA&P). 
                 These are fundamental to AI, as the key aspect 
		     of intelligence is being able to learn, reason, understand and act purposefully. 
		     But what does one learn and what does one reason with? The answer is "Knowledge". 
		     The questions then, are how does one express or represent knowledge and reason with knowledge. 
		     <br><br>

Thus the research in KR&R was driven by the quest to find appropriate knowledge 
		     representation formalisms and reasoning mechanisms, and the research in AA&P 
		     was focused on formulating acting purposefully (agent behavior) and formulating 
		     various aspects of commonsense reasoning, 
		     in which <a href="https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~tson/tutorials/rac-ijcai19.html">reasoning about 
		     actions plays a central role</a>. Our 2003 book chronicles our work as well as the substantial 
		     progress made in these two foundational areas. Since then while continuing working on these 
		     two foundational areas we have broadened our research to Cognition and Human Centered AI. 
		     <br><br>

In continuation of our work on KR & R we developed KR&R formalisms that combine probability with logic, 
		     and formulated causal and counterfactual reasoning and naive conditioning using that. 
		     In continuation of our work on AA&P we formulated the notion of maintainability and develop 
		     a "specification-to-code" methodology to create policies for maintainability goals and 
		     for goals in non-deterministic domains. We developed various goal specification languages 
		     and more recently developed a high level language for the multi-agent domains that allow 
		     agents to reason about other agent's knowledge or lack of it.
		     <br><br>

In recent years our focus has been on building integrated AI systems. To that end we have tried to 
		     bridge the gap between learning and reasoning and have developed systems that combine both. 
		     We developed an incremental and iterative method for learning rules.
		     <br><br>

<h3>Cognition:</h3> A crucial aspect of building integrated AI systems is cognition, defined (by Oxford Dictionary) 
		     as "the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, 
		     experience, and the senses." Our recent research has focused on cognition, especially with 
		     respect to understanding text and images. While in recent years purely neural 
		     approaches have been the goto methodology for both, we have focused on combining neural 
		     (and other machine learning methods) and reasoning with knowledge, and used question 
		     answering challenges as benchmarks to evaluate our approaches. We have focused on the hard 
		     challenges where knowledge (including commonsense knowledge) plays an important role.
		     <br><br>

<h3>Human Centered & Use Inspired AI: </h3> Robots and biological pathways were the initial domains that inspired us. 
		     Our robots in the AAAI 96 and 97 robot contests combined high level and low level reasoning. 
		     Since then we have worked on human robot interactions where humans communicate with robots using 
		     natural language to our recent foray on imitation learning where robots learn from demonstrations 
		     that include verbal commentary and instructions. 
		     <br><br>

Biochemical pathways inside cells regulate not just the cells but the organisms as a whole, and reasoning about them 
		     is needed to understand various phenomena, predict the impact of interventions (such as drugs), 
		     and design therapies. In addition, in the discovery phase, reasoning is needed to hypothesize 
		     missing knowledge.  We developed new reasoning about actions methodologies to reason in such domains, 
		     developed various information extraction (from text) methods for this domain, and combined text extraction 
		     and reasoning with pharmacokinetic knowledge to predict drug-drug interactions and identify novel 
		     drug indications. Recently in collaboration with researchers at Mayo we have been working on 
		     understanding clinical notes and patient databases for various health care applications. 
		     This includes cohort selection using clinical notes that involves identifying criteria and 
		     phenotypes such as drug abuse, alcohol abuse, decision making ability, major-diabetes, and 
		     elevated creatinine. Some of our other ongoing research in this area includes information 
		     extraction from clinical notes, automated document generation (in particular, survivor care plans), 
		     social media analysis and evidence synthesis. 
		     <br><br>

One of our most recent foray in use inspired AI is about vulnerability detection in program code using a 
		     man-machine collaboration approach.

Modeling multi-agent scenarios involving agents' knowledge about other's knowledge</strong><br>
Using answer set programming to model multi-agent scenarios involving agents' knowledge about other's knowledge.  We implement a new kind of action, which we call “ask-and truthfully-answer,” and show how this action brings forth a new dimension to the muddy children problem.</p>

Multi-Agent Action Modeling using Perspective Fluents</strong><br>
In a multi-agent setting the effect of actions on agents' knowledge depends on the agents' perspective; whether they are aware of the action, and whether they are close enough to observe the impact of the action. We introduce the notion of perspective fluents
and formalize (effect of) multi-agent actions using them.

Incremental and Iterative Learning of Answer Set Programs</strong><br>
Enhancing the traditional inductive logic programming to allow large number of 
(positive and negative) examples, each with its own background knowledge component.
Developing an incremental and iterative learning algorithm and system to learn 
answer set programs from such mutually distinct examples.</p>
